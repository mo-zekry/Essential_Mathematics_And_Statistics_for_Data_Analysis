## 1. Introduction to Probability 🎲

### Basic Definitions 📝

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Sample Space (S)** 🌐 | The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment |
| **Event (E)** 🎯 | A subset of the sample space; a collection of outcomes |
| **Outcome** 🎪 | A single result of an experiment |
| **Probability P(E)** 📊 | A measure of the likelihood of an event occurring |

#### Visualization of Sample Space 👁️

        C([Outcome 3])
        D([Outcome 4])
        E([Outcome 5])

    end

    P[/"P(E) = 3/6 = 0.5"/]
    S --> P
```

### Probability Rules 📏

1. **Rule 1** 1️⃣: The probability of any event is between 0 and 1 inclusive.
   $$0 \leq P(E) \leq 1$$

2. **Rule 2** 2️⃣: The sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes equals 1.
   $$\sum P(\text{outcome}_i) = 1$$

3. **Rule 3** 3️⃣: For mutually exclusive events E and F:
   $$P(E \text{ or } F) = P(E) + P(F)$$

4. **Rule 4** 4️⃣: For any event E:
   $$P(\text{not } E) = 1 - P(E)$$

#### Example: Coin Flip 🪙

```
Sample Space S = {Heads, Tails}
P(Heads) = 1/2 = 0.5
P(Tails) = 1/2 = 0.5
P(Heads) + P(Tails) = 1 ✓
```

## 2. Probability Distributions 📊

### Normal Distribution Overview 🔔

The normal distribution (also called Gaussian distribution) is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetrical around its mean, showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean.

#### Key Characteristics ✨:
- 🔔 Bell-shaped curve
- ⚖️ Symmetrical about the mean
- 📊 Mean, median, and mode are equal
- 🧮 Defined by two parameters: mean ($\mu$) and standard deviation ($\sigma$)
- 📏 Approximately 68% of data falls within $1\sigma$ of the mean
- 📏📏 Approximately 95% of data falls within $2\sigma$ of the mean
- 📏📏📏 Approximately 99.7% of data falls within $3\sigma$ of the mean (the "68-95-99.7 rule")

```mermaid

    y-axis "Probability Density" 0 --> 0.4
    line [0.01, 0.05, 0.15, 0.4, 0.15, 0.05, 0.01]
```

*Figure 5: Approximation of normal distribution showing the bell curve shape*

#### Standard Normal Distribution 📈

The standard normal distribution has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

## 3. Real-world Applications 🌎

### Probability in Decision-Making 🧠

#### Weather Forecasting ☔🌤️
Meteorologists use probability to express the likelihood of precipitation:
- "30% chance of rain" means that, based on current conditions, similar weather patterns have resulted in rainfall 30% of the time.

```mermaid
pie title "Weather Forecast for Week"
    "Rain" : 30
    "No Rain" : 70
```

*Figure 9: Weather forecast showing 30% probability of precipitation*

#### Risk Assessment ⚠️
Insurance companies use probability to calculate risk and set premium rates:

$$P(\text{car accident in next year}) = 0.05$$
$$\text{Cost if accident occurs} = \$15,000$$
$$\text{Expected cost} = 0.05 \times \$15,000 = \$750$$

```mermaid
quadrantChart
    title "Risk Assessment Matrix"
    x-axis "Low Impact" --> "High Impact"
    y-axis "Low Probability" --> "High Probability"
    quadrant-1 "High Risk (Mitigate)"
    quadrant-2 "Very High Risk (Avoid)"
    quadrant-3 "Low Risk (Accept)"
    quadrant-4 "Medium Risk (Transfer)"
    "Minor Traffic Violation": [0.2, 0.6]
    "Car Accident": [0.8, 0.05]
    "Weather Damage": [0.5, 0.2]
    "Total Loss": [0.95, 0.01]
```

#### Quality Control 🏭
Manufacturers use probability to determine acceptable defect rates:

```mermaid
xychart-beta
    title "Quality Control Chart: Defect Rate Over Time"
    x-axis ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun"]
    y-axis "Defect %" 0 --> 5
    line [2.1, 1.8, 2.4, 3.6, 2.9, 2.2]
    line [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
    line [3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]
```
